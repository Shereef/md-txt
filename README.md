# md-txt

Uses `markdown-to-txt` by @ejrbuss to create a cli that converts markdown to text

```
	Usage
	  $ md-txt source.md destination.txt

	Example
	  $ md-txt CHANGELOG.md CHANGELOG.txt

	Options
	  -f, --force    force overwrite of destination file
	  -v, --verbose  verbose output
```

## Motivation

I wanted to use this to sanitize release notes going from github to stackholders on a platform that didn't support markdown
